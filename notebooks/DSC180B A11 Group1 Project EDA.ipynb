    "For performing EDA, we will utilize just certain number of QCD and Signal jets for memory and runtime optimization. Source of these files are located either in `train_mass_qcd` for QCD jets or `train_mass_hbb` for Signal jets. Those directories are then separated into numbers of subdirectories. On average, the size of `.root` files for QCD data is far smaller than those for Signal data; this is possibly due to QCD data existing in smaller partitioned files than Signal data. According to our calculation, approximately $55$ `.root` files of QCD jets are as big as $8$ `.root` files of Signal jets in terms of file(byte) size. Hence by default, `path_generator()` generates $55$ random QCD `.root` files and $8$ random Signal `.root` files."

    "There are not only multiple jet types, but also multiple jet mass variable in our datasets including `fj_genjetmsd`, `fj_genjetmass`, `fj_msoftdrop`, `fj_genRes_mass`. However all their measures differ as they're computed using different approaches. For example, `fj_msoftdrop` is a jet sub-constructure output from soft drop declustering, which is a technique that recursively removes soft wide-angle radiation from a jet using parameters like soft threshold($z_{cut}$) and angular exponent(Î²). On the other hand, `fj_genjetmsd`, which is our target variable, is a generator-level soft drop mass measured based on generator-level particles, or existing particles before any detector interactions. Because of this, **incorporating `fj_msoftdrop` in our model training process won't bias overall learning of the model.** So now, we'll check if `fj_msoftdrop` is an effective feature for predicting generator-level soft drop mass(`fj_genjetmsd`) of a jet by computing coefficient of correlation($R$) and sketching scatterplot. Unlike reconstructured soft drop mass, `fj_genjetmass` and `fj_genRes_mass` are mass variables measured at the collision-generator level. In other words, these two mass variables are the closest to the **true** jet mass. Therefore, they cannot be employed for model training process."

    "### Relationship between number of secondary verticies recorded in a jet and its mass\n",
    "\n",
    "When two protons collide, the collision produces particles that soon decay into other sub-particles. However, not all particles, or sub-particles, decay at the same rate; typically, heavier particles have longer lifespan than lighter particles, which allows them to travel further away from the origin collision point(AKA *primary vertex*). At some point, those heavy particles decay into sub-particles as well, at which the decay point is recorded distant from origin collision point. This distant decay point is what scientists refer as *secondary vertex*. In other words, secondary vertices are usually recorded in a jet that contains some particles heavy enough to travel distant away from origin collision point. Based on this theory, we wanted to answer: Do the jets that have more secondary vertices recorded tend to be heavier than those that have fewer secondary vertices. We will check this potential relationship by plotting boxplot and linear-regression plot(`lmplot`)"

From above boxplots, we can see clear positive trend in jet mass for QCD jets as more secondary vertices are recorded in them. Surprisingly, signal jets failed to show as strong positive trend in jet mass with respect to increasing number of recorded secondary vertices.

It is also known that particles capable of traveling further have relatively longer lifespan. And the longer the lifespan of the particle, the heavier the particle tends to be. Based on this theory, we believe those jets with high transverse momentum are likely to be heavy.
