Our dataset resides in DSMLP server, and all our scripts are written using (absolute) file paths with respect to the location on the server. 

In order to utilize Github for collaborative setup, full training and test sets had to be kept on DSMLP server. If required, we might upload one or two sample .root files for demonstration purpose.

Raw training and test sets that exist as .root format exist under `teams` folder
Processed training and test sets, or output from GraphDataset.py, are stored under `processed` folder
